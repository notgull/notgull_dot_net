If you would like to contact me, please contact me over Discord, under the
account `notgull#6295`. If you send me a friend request for the purposes of
communication I will likely accept it, as long as you have a non-obscene profile
picture and username.

If you would like a more reliable means of communication (e.g. for business communication),
contact me through the above Discord and I will provide you with a more reliable medium
(read: email).

I have a Twitter account with the handle [@EelRemoval](https://twitter.com/EelRemoval), a
Reddit account with the handle [/u/EelRemoval](https://old.reddit.com/user/EelRemoval), a
GitHub account with the handle [notgull](https://github.com/notgull), and a YouTube channel
under the name [notgull](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa22ge_MKVapVkX8lN1jDuQ). The
communication channels for these accounts are not actively monitored and are not reliable
means of communication. While I am occasionally active on other social media platforms, any
accounts not in the above set should be assumed to be impostors.
