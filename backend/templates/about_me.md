Hello! My name isn't as important as the pseudonym I've plastered over this website. I'm
a Cybersecurity student at an unspecified university in the Midwest.

I got my hands on a QBASIC interpreter at the age of 8, and ever since I've been
programming in some way, shape or form. I am the leader developer for the
[Bread Graphics](https://github.com/bread-graphics) project, and a somewhat
active participant in the open source economy.

In 2017, I began writing for the [SCP Wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/notgull). Since
then, I have written over 70 SCPs and tales. Highlights include 
[my 001 proposal](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/not-a-seagull-proposal),
[SCP-3733](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3733),
[Team Bird](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bird), and
[The Little Robot that Could](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-little-robot-that-could).

I also create animations and other things on my 
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa22ge_MKVapVkX8lN1jDuQ), if that's
your flavor.

On this blog, I'll talk about technology (mostly the making of), art (the writing
variety), and whatever else crosses my mind.
